# Shooting method ODE solver
I do not allow to copy any line of this code for anybody that did not ever studied or worked in MTSU

This program is written in C and is going to be extended with some Python code later in July.
It is also possible that I will add some parallel stuff if I see any benefit of it on  such small computations.

If you want to try it:
<p> 1) download everything.
<p> 2) run make in your lovely UNIX console.(need some gcc)
<p> 3) enjoy flying numbers.
